This datatable my first React project with Ant Design. It was a really enjoyable experience. 
First of all, I created dynamic data just for fun. The invoice amount and date are generated randomly. A user can search data by input, or add filters by select options.
When the "Ekle" button is clicked, a tag containing select values is created. A user can close this tag in order to remove the filter. Sorting options in the columns are working.
Input search is also working. 

Nowadays no one can imagine a dashboard without theme switching. I added a switch button for themes. This data is stored on local storage, but if there is no data, the user's preferred theme will be used.
This project was coded in approximately two days.
